<div class="about">
	<p>Jen Foods GmbH imports a huge variety of food products into Germany and many of them comes from Asia and other parts of the World. By the end of 2018, there are about 65% of our trading volumes are <b>Asian food</b> or product of Asia, while the rest are <b>Global seafood</b> (<a href="en_product.html" target="_blank">Product List</a>).</p>
<p>We are always open for new sources on above products, much appreciated if you could contact us when your product is suitable for our business. The sourcing team (<a href="mailto:import@jenfoods.com">import@jenfoods.com</a>) will follow up your proposal.</p><br>
<p><b>We suggest every new supplier to read following part in depth.</b></p>
<p>1) Make sure that your product is fully complied with EU & German regulations on the aspect of including but not limited to quality, ingredients, additives, packaging (food contact), labels, etc. Any incorrect subjects related should be undertaken by the sellers.</p>
<p>2) As such, we aim to ensure all our suppliers get qualified by HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) and ISO 22000 as a minimum. Some retail products we need that to meet BRC (British Retail Consortium) standard (Grade A/B) and IFS (International Food Standard) based on retail channel force.  GLOBAL G.A.P. to vegetable & fruit also MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) on fish & seafood surely would be preferred. When products arrive at our depots, we have in-house standards to guarantee the products make the grade.</p>
<p>3) A specification sheet with detailed parameters is required for every single range as we have to check through to learn it well then decide finally what we do. PDF format is recommended.</p>
<p>4) The products need to be packed for given private brands. Our designers will provide all the files in demand. And of course, we also distribute brands from suppliers, by doing that, we totally require an exclusive licence at least within Germany.</p>
<p>Let's connect and grow business together.</p>
